<div class="entry-content"><h2>What is THEC Talks ?</h2>
<blockquote><p><strong>THEC Talks</strong> is an opportunity for students to exchange experiences and insights about web-related technical subjects. The first edition took place at <a href="http://www.hec.edu/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.hec.edu']);">HEC Paris</a> on May 23<sup>rd</sup> 2011, and was a part of the <a href="http://www.hec.edu/Certificates/Digital-Innovation-for-Business/About-the-certificate" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','www.hec.edu']);">Digital Business for Innovation</a> certificate.</p>
<p>This event was organized by and for the students of HEC Paris. The talks all have one rule in common : <strong>practice over theory</strong>. That is why efforts were made to be as much hands-on as possible, with lots of live demos and visuals. </p>
<p>We made everything available on this website : videos, slides and useful links. Feel free to have a look at them !</p></blockquote>
